* **string**
 
a string: when you put either " (double-quotes) or ' (single-quotes) around the text.

To formatted variables in the string, use a % (percent) character, followed by the variable. (r,s,d,)

To print multiple variables, you need to put them inside ( ) (parenthesis) separated by , (commas). 

**Zhe:**
To formatted variables in the string, use a {} character, then call the variables as .format(variables)

    print "I said {}".format(a)
