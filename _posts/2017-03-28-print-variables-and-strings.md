How a print comment should work, especially with string type.

### print

* "print" with small letter "p"

### string
 
* A string: when you put either " (double-quotes) or ' (single-quotes) around the text.

* To formatted variables in the string, use a % (percent) character, followed by the variable. (r,s,d,)

* To print multiple variables, you need to put them inside ( ) (parenthesis) separated by , (commas). 

* **_Zhe:_**
To formatted variables in the string, use a {} character, then call the variables
as .format(variables)

    ``` python
    a = 10
    print "I said {}".format(a)
    ```
